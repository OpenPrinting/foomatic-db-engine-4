.TH FOOMATIC-KITLOAD 8 "2001-05-07" "Foomatic Project"
.SH NAME
foomatic-kitload \- installs a data kit into the foomatic database.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B foomatic-kitload
[\fI \-k kit-dir\fR]
[\fI \-d dest-dir\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-kitload
installs a foomatic data kit into the local data library.  It takes a 
\fI\-k\fR \fIdirname\fR
option, where \fIdirname\fR is the toplevel directory of a foomatic
driver "kit".  A "kit" is a selection of XML source files arranged
exactly as in the source/section of the master database (ie, opt/driver/printer/ subdirs).

Gimp-Print's foomatic-generator produces exactly such a kit.

Foomatic-kitload is moderately paranoid about kits: the kit must
contain at least one of \fIprinter\fR, \fIdriver\fR or \fIopt\fR; the
kit must contain only files ending in \fI.xml\fR, the kit cannot be
the local library itself, etc.  But it does not inspect the contents
of the kit files in any way.


.SS Options
.TP 10
.BI \-k \ dirname
dirname is the toplevel directory of a foomatic driver "kit". 
.TP 10
.BI \-d \ destdir
destdir is a prefix to prepend to the install path.  This will not normally
be required, but is useful if installing into a temporary `staging area'
prior to installing in the final destination.
